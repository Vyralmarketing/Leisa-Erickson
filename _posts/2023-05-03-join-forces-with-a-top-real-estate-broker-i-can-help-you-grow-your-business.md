Lately, I’ve heard that some people are worried about working with me because they see me as their competition, but I’m here today to tell you that couldn’t be farther from the truth. In reality, I can help you in many ways, and I have a lot that I can bring to the table for you. Plus, my team is a building base for helping people get to higher level skills than they would’ve hit on their own.

Know that I would never compete with you—in contrast, I know the marketplace and can help you win listings. In the ten years that I've been working in real estate, I rarely compete with other people in the market—and **if I did compete with you, it would automatically be your deal, no questions asked. **

Overall, you should know that there’s a big difference between a broker who sits in their office and one who works in the field, and I am the latter. I am your colleague, and I can help you test all of the shiny objects that come your way. I like to test things so you don’t have to spend your money on something that may not work. Then **I can give you great advice on what to do, what not to do, where to spend your money, and where you're going to get a good return.&nbsp;**

With me, you can get access to the best coaching in the business. Plus, access to our resources is free! I truly want to help you succeed, not compete with you. I would love to have a conversation about taking your business to the next level, so if that’s something you’re interested in, call or email me anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
